## Project structure

```
src/
├── Core/          # Shared logic: SheetsClient, SkipperResolver, SheetsWriter, etc.
├── PHPUnit/       # PHPUnit 10/11/12 extension
├── Pest/          # Pest v2/v3 plugin (built on PHPUnit integration)
├── Behat/         # Behat 3.x extension + context
├── Mink/          # Mink + Behat context
├── Codeception/   # Codeception 5 extension
├── PHPSpec/       # PHPSpec 7/8 extension + listener
└── Kahlan/        # Kahlan 5 plugin helper
tests/
└── Core/          # Unit tests for Core components
```

Each framework integration should:
- Initialize the resolver (or rehydrate from cache) before tests run
- Skip disabled tests using the framework's native skip mechanism
- Collect discovered test IDs for sync mode
- Call `SheetsWriter::sync()` after all tests finish (sync mode only)

See existing integrations for reference patterns.
